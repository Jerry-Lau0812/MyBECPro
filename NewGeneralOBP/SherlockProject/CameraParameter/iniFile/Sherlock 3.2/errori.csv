-1,General error message
0,Function executed successfully
1,Invalid camera handle
Most of the uEye SDK functions expect the camera handle as the first parameter.
2,An IO request from the uEye driver failed. Possibly the versions of the ueye_api.dll (API) and the driver file (ueye_usb.sys or ueye_eth.sys) do not match.
3,An attempt to initialize or select the camera failed (no camera connected or initialization error).
11,Error opening a Windows registry key
12,Error reading settings from the Windows registry
15,The driver could not allocate memory.
16,The driver could not release the allocated memory.
17,Communication with the driver failed because no driver has been loaded.
18,The function is not supported yet.
32,The function can not be executed in the current camera operating mode (free run, trigger or standby).
49,Invalid pointer or invalid memory ID
50,File cannot be opened for writing or reading.
51,The file cannot be opened.
52,The specified file is not a valid bitmap file.
53,The bitmap size is not correct (bitmap too large).
108,No active image memory available. You must set the memory to active using the is_SetImageMem() function or create a sequence using the is_AddToSequence() function.
112,The sequence list is empty and cannot be deleted.
113,The image memory is already included in the sequence and cannot be added again.
117,The memory could not be locked. The pointer to the buffer is invalid.
118,The device ID is invalid. Valid IDs start from 1 for USB cameras, and from 1001 for GigE cameras.
119,The board ID is invalid. Valid IDs range from 1 through 255.
120,All cameras are in use.
122,A timeout occurred. An image capturing process could not be terminated within the allowable period.
123,Invalid array
125,One of the submitted parameters is outside the valid range or is not supported for this sensor or is not available in this mode.
127,No memory could be allocated.
129,An internal error has occured.
139,The camera is connected to a port which does not support the USB 2.0 high-speed standard.
Cameras without a memory board cannot be operated on a USB 1.1 port.
140,A capturing operation is in progress and must be terminated before you can start another one.
145,The requested image is not available in the camera memory or is no longer valid.
148,The function cannot be used because the camera is waiting for a trigger signal.
151,A CRC error-correction problem occurred while reading the settings.
152,This function has not been enabled yet in this version.
153,The camera does not contain any calibration data.
154,The system is waiting for the kernel driver to respond.
155,The camera model used here does not support this function or setting.
156,The function is not possible as trigger is disabled.
157,The dialog was canceled without a selection so that no file could be saved.
158,An internal structure has an incorrect size.
159,The image memory has an inappropriate size to store the image in the desired format.
160,This setting is not available for the currently set pixel clock frequency.
161,This setting is not available for the currently set exposure time.
162,This setting cannot be changed while automatic exposure time control is enabled.
163,The BackBuffer surface cannot be created.
164,The BackBuffer mix surface cannot be created.
165,The BackBuffer overlay memory cannot be locked.
166,The BackBuffer overlay memory cannot be created.
167,Not supported in BackBuffer Overlay mode.
168,Back buffer surface invalid.
169,Back buffer surface not found.
170,Error releasing the overlay device context.
171,The back buffer timer could not be created.
172,The back buffer overlay was not enabled.
173,Only possible in BackBuffer mode.
174,Invalid color format
175,Mono binning/mono sub-sampling do not support automatic white balance.
176,Invalid I2C device address
177,The current image could not be processed.
178,Transfer error. Frequent transfer errors can mostly be avoided by reducing the pixel rate.
179,Parameter set is not present.
180,The camera type defined in the .ini file does not match the current camera model.
181,Invalid HIBYTE of host address
182,The color mode is not supported in the current display mode.
183,No IR filter available
184,The camera's starter firmware is not compatible with the driver and needs to be updated.
185,The DirectRenderer library could not be found.
186,Not enough graphics memory available.
187,The image surface or overlay surface could not be created.
188,The vertex buffer could not be created.
189,The texture could not be created.
190,The overlay surface could not be locked.
191,The overlay surface could not be unlocked.
192,Could not get the device context handle for the overlay.
193,Could not release the device context handle for the overlay.
194,Function is not supported by the graphics hardware.
195,Because of other incompatible settings the function is not possible.
196,A device context handle is still open in the application.
197,The device is already paired.
198,The subnet mask of the camera and PC network card are different.
199,The subnet of the camera and PC network card are different.
200,The configuration of the IP address is invalid.
201,The device is not compatible to the drivers.
202,The settings for the image size of the camera are not compatible to the PC network card.
203,The configuration of the network card is invalid.
204,The configuration of the CPU idle has failed.
